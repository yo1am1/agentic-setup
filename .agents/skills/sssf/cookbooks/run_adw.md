# Run ADW

Run a workflow and report on it. **You run and observe — you never step into the process or do the work yourself.**

## Step 0 — translate the request

**Read [how_to_prompt_for_the_eng.md](how_to_prompt_for_the_eng.md) before you launch anything.** The prompt you pass is read by every agent in the chain, so it gets written deliberately: same intent, sharper words, verified paths, and a stated "done means". That cookbook is the whole procedure; this one starts once you have the prompt.

## The orchestrator's posture

The ADW is the worker. Your job is to launch it, watch the trace, and tell the engineer what happened. Do not read the agent's target files and "help", do not fix the code an agent was supposed to fix, do not edit an envelope. If a run fails, report the failing phase and its violations — the fix is a config, prompt, or ADW change, made deliberately, and then a re-run.

## Launch

Which chain to launch is decided in `how_to_prompt_for_the_eng.md`, and the short version is: **the ADW the engineer named, or else the most complete composed chain the work justifies — never a single-agent one.** Read `ls adws/adw_*.py` and the `Phases:` line in each docstring to see what this repo has; the names below are shape, not a menu.

```bash
uv run adws/<end-to-end-chain>.py "add a /health endpoint"
uv run adws/<plan-build-verify-chain>.py requests/health.md
uv run adws/<build-first-chain>.py "implement the plan" --adw-id a1b2c3d4
uv run adws/<recon-chain>.py "where is auth handled" --config path/to/other.config.yaml
```

The prompt is inline text or a file path. Launch in the background so you can poll while it works; the `adw_id` is printed on startup — capture it, everything else keys off it.

The web app at `:4600` is one way to launch these; it is not the only one. Any
linked repo carries `.agents/skills/sssf/SKILL.md` — a skill pi and DeepSeek
Harness both discover on their own, so an interactive `pi` or `dsh` session
in the repo can launch a workflow through its own bash tool without the
browser. It documents the same commands above, plus the safety rule that
matters most for an agent-initiated launch: never run `sdlc`/`fusion-sdlc`
from inside a session that is itself an SSSF phase.

### Listen for the roster

The chain says *what runs*; the config says *who runs it*. **If the engineer references a roster, a config, or a model tier, pass it — do not fall through to the default.**

```bash
ls adws/adw_sssf_config/*.yaml          # available rosters
```

Read what is actually there from disk every time. This factory ships **one**
roster, `sssf.config.yaml` — every agent routed through the local OmniRoute
gateway, and a `fusion:` block naming the default debate panel and its
synthesizer. Rosters are the engineer's to add, rename, and retune, so both
the count and any name you remember from a doc are guesses until you look.

They will rarely say `--config`. Treat any of these as naming a roster, then resolve it to a file:

| What they say | What it means |
|---|---|
| "run it on the X config", "use the X roster" | the roster file whose name matches — check, it may not exist |
| "run this with the big models", "use the sota roster" | the non-default roster — confirm which if there is more than one. Each config's header comment lists the names it answers to, so `head -3` on the file settles it |
| "have opus plan this one" | a roster whose planner is that model; if none exists, say so rather than editing the config mid-request |
| nothing about models at all | the default, `adws/adw_sssf_config/sssf.config.yaml` |

`--config` takes the path directly:

```bash
uv run adws/<chain>.py "<prompt>" --config adws/adw_sssf_config/<roster>.yaml
```

Two things that bite:

- **Never swap rosters on your own.** A different roster is a different cost and a different result. If the default's model looks wrong for the work, say so and let the engineer choose.
- **Switching rosters mid-session breaks resumption.** `agent_map.json` records the model each coding-agent session was created with, so a joined run (`--adw-id`) whose config now names a different model starts that agent **fresh** instead of resuming its context window. That is deliberate — a bad resume is worse — but it means "plan on one roster, then build on another" costs the builder its accumulated context. Say so when you report it.

`--adw-id` is optional on **every** ADW. Given one, the run joins that session if it exists or creates it pinned to exactly that id: same `sessions/{adw_id}/` dirs, same `context_handoff/`, envelopes appended, and each agent resumes its existing coding-agent context window via `agent_map.json`. That is how you chain ADWs — plan under one id, then build under the same id.

## Observe

The trace db is `adws/adw_data/sssf.db`. It is WAL, so reads never block the running writers — poll it as often as you like.

```bash
# where the run stands
sqlite3 adws/adw_data/sssf.db \
  "select seq, name, kind, owner, status, attempt from phases where adw_id='a1b2c3d4' order by seq;"

# the live tail — cursor on rowid, same query the visualizer polls
sqlite3 adws/adw_data/sssf.db \
  "select rowid, type, name, started_at from events where adw_id='a1b2c3d4' and rowid > 0 order by rowid limit 50;"

# why a phase failed
sqlite3 adws/adw_data/sssf.db \
  "select attempt, gate, passed, checks_json from gate_results where adw_id='a1b2c3d4';"

# session-level status
sqlite3 adws/adw_data/sssf.db \
  "select adw_id, request, status, total_tokens from sessions order by started_at desc limit 5;"

# what an agent actually did, slowest tool calls first
sqlite3 adws/adw_data/sssf.db \
  "select name, tokens, started_at, ended_at from events
   where adw_id='a1b2c3d4' and type='tool_call' order by ended_at desc limit 20;"
```

Poll on a cursor: keep the highest `rowid` you have seen and query `where rowid > ?`. Don't re-read the whole table each pass.

`tool_call` rows carry a real span, so durations come off the columns — see `references/observability.md` for which fields each event type populates.

The ADW also narrates to stdout, and every line it prints is written to the db as a `log` event — terminal and swim lane tell the same story by construction, so tailing the background process is a valid second view rather than a competing source of truth.

Files are the raw record if you need more than the db shows: `adws/adw_data/sessions/{adw_id}/{agent}/raw_output.jsonl` (full coding-agent stream), `envelope.json` (the parsed final response), `prompts/` (exactly what was sent), and `context_handoff/` (what agents wrote for each other). A human at the web app reads the same files without leaving the browser — a path in an envelope or a `ph.log()` (Fusion's `plan_path`, `report`, any `artifacts` entry) is a clickable button that opens it rendered, `.md` and `.json` included; see `references/observability.md`.

## When a run is stuck

A hung coding agent produces no events at all, so the trace goes quiet rather than red. Read it in this order:

Query `phases` and `processes` in `adws/adw_data/sssf.db`; signal only the
recorded PIDs whose live command still matches the trace.

`processes` rows with `ended_at IS NULL` are the live ones. If a pi child exists
but the phase has produced no `tool_call` events and `raw_output.jsonl` is empty,
the agent never started properly; check model resolution instead of waiting.

A killed run marks itself `fail` and closes its process rows, so the trace never claims work is in flight that is already dead.

## Report

Tell the engineer, in order: which chain and which roster you launched (name the config whenever it was not the default), which phase is running now (or which failed), phase statuses in sequence, and for a failure the gate violations or the error verbatim. Remember **every phase defaults to `fail`** — a phase showing `fail` may simply never have completed; `queued` means it never started. Don't dress up a partial run as a success.

The visualizer polls this same db; the sqlite queries above remain the headless equivalent.
